                Its gameplay focuses on fast-paced, highly-stylized combat; a
                high style ranking requires long attack and evasion strings
                while avoiding damage. Although the game also features
                puzzle-solving and exploration elements retained from its
                survival-horror origins, they are downplayed in favor of action.

                Dante is generally the games' lead character. However, most of
                the games offer other playable characters. The ability to
                perform combination attacks in mid-air and evasion and
                weapon-change buttons were introduced. With the latter, a player
                can cycle through ranged weapons without switching to the
                inventory screen.

                A selection of gameplay styles were added, allowing the player
                to focus on favorite techniques or weapons. Each of the four
                styles gains experience points, which unlock more techniques and
                abilities without costing red orbs (the series' currency). A
                second weapon-change button was added, allowing the player to
                cycle through a character's melee weaponry.

                Nero's Devil Bringer arm gives players the ability to pull
                distant enemies in to be attacked or destroyed. Nero is also
                armed with a sword which can be throttled up, allowing players
                to pre-charge it for extra damage on the next hit; with precise
                timing, it can be charged after each attack for extra damage and
                style.

                A collection of the series' first three games for the
                PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, ported by Pipeworks Software and
                Double Helix Games, eventually released on March 22, 2012 in
                Japan and March 29, 2012 in the US.[7] It was later ported to
                the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows on March 13,
                2018.

              <p>
                This title in the Devil May Cry series introduced changing
                environments to the gameplay. Players could reach hidden areas
                with the Ophion whip and grappling hook, and the weapon had
                similar functions to the Devil Bringer in Devil May Cry 4. The
                environment often "attacked" Dante by changing its architecture
                and infrastructure to a more-hostile form, prompting fast-paced
                chase sequences and platforming scenarios.

                Released in 2019, this game introduces a character named V, who
                controls three demons in battle due to his weak physical state.
                Nero and Dante return as playable characters, although Nero is
                weaker with the replacement of his Devil Bringer by a mechanical
                prosthesis.

                Its rendition of Dante's appearance was criticized, and the
                developers promised to fix it when the game left the beta period
                for release in 2020.
